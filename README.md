# ChatConsole

Add commands to the in-game chat. 

Since we haven't found a way to get the chat in singleplayer please play multiplayer for this (doesn't change anything else).

## List of commands

Commands look like this : ```/command <Mandatory Field> [Optional Field]```.

I you don't specify a ```[username]```, the command will apply to you. Usernames have to be exact and are case sensitive.
<br><br>

* ```/help [command]``` gives you a list of all commands or information on a specified command.
* ```/give <item name or id> [amount] [username]``` gives the specified player any number of one item. Default amount is 1.
* ```/remove <item name or id> [amount] [username]``` remove the any number of one item from the specified player. Default amount is 1.
* ```/gold <amount> [username]``` gives the specified player gold.
* ```/lvl <number>``` gives levels to all players (exp is shared in RoRR).
* ```/spawntp``` spawns a teleporter at your location that sends you to the next stage (it cannot make you go to the final stage).
* ```/god [username]``` make the specified player invulnerable (this doesn't make you invulnerable to falldamage, but falldamage can't kill you anyway).
* ```/kill [username or monster name]``` kills the specified player or all monsters from the specified monstertype.
* ```/pvp``` enables pvp mode in multiplayer, setting each player to different teams. You can still be damaged by monsters.
* ```/skill <skillbar slot> <skill name or skill id> [username]``` replace a skill by another in your skillbar. The skillbar slots are numbered 1-4.
* ```/peaceful``` prevents ennemies from spawning (except from the teleporter)


* ```/set <field> <value> [username]``` sets an attribute field for the player.

The possible fields for ```/set``` are : ```armor, attack_speed, critical_chance, damage, hp_regen, maxhp, maxbarrier, maxshield, armor_level, attack_speed_level, critical_chance_level, damage_level, hp_regen_level, maxhp_cap, maxhp_level```.

Host Only
* ```/kick [username]``` kick the specified user from the game.

## Adding commands from other mods

You can add your own command like this :

```lua
examplemod = true -- this lets you locate your own mod later
-- actor instance who wrote the command
-- args1... the words separated by spaces in order after the command ("/command args1 args2 args3 ..."). These are strings containing any non-space characters
function example_func(actor, args1, args2)
    -- your code here
end

mods.on_all_mods_loaded(function() 
    -- find chatconsole script
    for k, v in pairs(mods) do if type(v) == "table" and v.chatconsole then ChatConsole = v end end 
    -- add the function you want to add
    for k, v in pairs(mods) do
        if type(v) == "table" and v.examplemod then 
            -- name in the function array, reference, usage text, command ("/example")
            -- optional fields go at the end after mandatory fields (you can avoid doing this if you know what you're doing)
            -- you can overwrite default commands by using the same name (here examplemod_examplefunc)
            ChatConsole.add_function(examplemod_examplefunc, v.example_func, "example", "<y>/example <example mandatory field> [example optional field]")
        end 
    end
end)
```
